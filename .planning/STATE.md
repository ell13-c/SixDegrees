# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** A user opens the People Map and immediately sees meaningful nearby people around themselves at (0,0), with stable, explainable positions that update daily.
**Current focus:** Phase 20 - Global Coordinate Data Contract

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Phase 20 - Global Coordinate Data Contract)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Completed (Phase 20 complete)
Last activity: 2026-02-26 - Completed 20-03 map API global-contract wiring and metadata contract tests.

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 20 | 3 | 8 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 20-03 (2 min), 20-02 (2 min), 20-01 (4 min)
- Trend: Stable
| Phase 20 P02 | 2 min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 20 P03 | 2 min | 2 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 20-23]: v2.0 phases start at 20 and derive only from v2.0 requirements.
- [Phase 22]: frontend behavior remains compatible with no frontend code changes.
- [Phase 20/22]: `profiles` and `pending_requests` schema remain unchanged.
- [Phase 20]: Do not migrate legacy `user_profiles` users into `profiles`; v2.0 runtime scope is existing `profiles` users only.
- [Phase 20]: Rebuild `interactions` from `posts`/`likes`/`comments` for profiles users, then repoint FKs to `profiles(id)`.
- [Phase 23]: Milestone cannot close until DB/runtime have zero `user_profiles` dependency and safe drop is complete.
- [Phase 20]: Use upsert_global_map_coordinates JSONB RPC so backend publishes one batch timestamp/version across all users.
- [Phase 20]: Preserve one-step movement continuity in SQL by assigning prev_x/prev_y from current row on conflict updates.
- [Phase 20]: Rebuild interactions via truncate and deterministic re-aggregation from profile-scoped activity before enforcing FK constraints.
- [Phase 20]: Standardize interaction FK names to fk_interactions_user_a_profiles and fk_interactions_user_b_profiles after removing any user_profiles references.
- [Phase 20]: Map route reads now use get_global_map_coordinates and return shared version metadata from global rows.
- [Phase 20]: Map contract tests now require version_date/computed_at with deterministic RPC mocks to prevent false-green 404 behavior.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Parameter tuning and stability thresholds for global embedding require benchmark-based calibration during phase planning.
- Live DB currently has interactions FKs to `user_profiles`; Phase 20 must resolve FK repoint + integrity validation before any drop.
